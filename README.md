An API for creating genetic simulations in dart.
The API uses a combination of the genetic algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) and some assumptions regarding expected fluctuations in traits not specifically linked to genetics e.g. height, to simulate actors in a simulations breeding with one another. A childs traits are usually a combination of their parents with the aforementioned flucuations where applicable. That being said, according to the genetic algorithm there is a 0.6% chance for a random mutation to occur. This random mutation is currently a just a change in an existing trait but I would like to add the ability for new traits to emerge such as sexual desireability etc.
